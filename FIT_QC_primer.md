### Accessing objects in QCDB
For example to see instances of object called `Amp_channel0` created by `FV0::DigitQcTask` go to:  
http://ccdb-test.cern.ch:8080/browse/qc/FV0/MO/DigitQcTask/Amp_channel0
![ccdb_links](graphics/screens/ccdb_links.png)

One can find the path to the object by clicking *`i`* icon in qcg ![qcg_i_icon](graphics/screens/qcg_i_icon.png)

### Layouts
Layouts are used to create interactive dashboards containing several plots and organized in desired way. They are created in simple drag-and-drop manner. Layouts contain tabs, one can also specify certain plotting options for each object.
One can create new layout by clicking `+` on the left panel in qcg:

# FIT data structure:

## Digits
So far all FIT QC process data in `digit` format. The structure is following (for FV0 - FT0 and FDD may slightly differ):

![alt_text](graphics/screens/digits_structure.png)

In short, FV0DigitCh contains (channelID, time, charge) for each hit coming from PM and FV0DigitBC contains:
- InteractionRecord, i.e. precise time information via storing Orbit and BC (convertable to nanosec w.r.t certain time 0 by `o2::InteractionRecord::bc2ns`)
- information from TCM: triggerSignals (bit-by-bit info about fired triggers) and several quantities computed on TCM like `nChanA` (number of fired channels on A side), `amplA` (sum of amplitudes on side A **divided by 8**). For FT0 there is also `timeA` (average time on A side) and equivalent fields for C side.


<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

# QC framework structure

QC framework defines 3 main classes described in next sections: QcTasks, PostProcessingTask and Checker, which are base for the code developed by each detector team.

There are two types of QC objects: MonitoringObjects (MO) and QualityObjects (QO).
MO are ROOT objects, typically histograms or graphs. QO are basically numbers specifying quality of given MO (1=Good/2=Medium/3=Bad and 10=Null = the worst). Qos and be [aggregated](https://github.com/AliceO2Group/QualityControl/blob/master/doc/ModulesDevelopment.md#quality-aggregation).

*As of today (21.10.2021), the policy for storage is following: everything is kept for 24h, after that only one version of each MO/QO per hour is preserved. Trending can be used to keep information about the time evolution with granularity greater than 1/h.*

## QcTasks:
They take as an input all data in form of digits so are able to compute everything. They create and publish MOs.

## PostProcessingTasks:
Take as the input MO and create new MO. They can work asynchronously. Useful if one wants to combine objects from different sources (e.g. BC pattern from CCDB).

Especially useful example of postprocessing provided in Common part is [TrendingTask](https://github.com/AliceO2Group/QualityControl/blob/master/doc/PostProcessing.md#the-trendingtask-class). One can create trending plot for most commonly used quantities (like mean, stddev, entries of histogram) by adding just several lines to the config file.

## Checkers:
Take as the input MO (or list of MOs) and determines its quality encapsulated into QO.

Useful part of the checker is `beautify()` function (called only if the input is single MO). It allows to modify visual aspects of the input MO - one can for instance modify colors to reflect the quality of the object or add `TPaveText`, which will provide a message or instructions for the shifter.

# FIT QC tasks

List of tasks implemented for FIT (FV0 and FT0 for now):
- DigitQcTask -- main QcTasks, dumps to 1- and 2D histograms most of the information available in digits. In particular it generates separately BC-orbit maps for: all events, for each trigger and for each FEE piece (PM and TCM).

- TriggerQcTask -- takes information from PMs and repeats the logic implemented on TCM to validate the triggers

- BasicPPTask -- postprocessing task which computes trigger rates (+ TPofiles for time and amplitude VS channel)

- OutOfBunchCollTask and OutOfBunchCollCheck -- postprocessing that combines BcOrbitMap with the LHC filling scheme (aka BC pattern) and finds the events which are out-of-the-bunch. Checker compares ratio of out-of-the-bunch events to all events with warning/error thresholds.

- CFDEffCheck -- for each channel computes efficiency of getting charge information when time information was available (charge is not available - and set to zero - in case of time miscalibration).

- CalibrationTask and ChannelTimeCalibrationCheck -- check performance of time offset calibration procedure


### Note on Trigger Rates

Trigger rates are computed by taking number of entries in each bin in `qc/FV0/MO/DigitQcTask/Triggers` by cycle duration. Currently the cycle duration is computed using 3 different methods (after tests with real beam one method should be chosen and the rest removed):
1. convert InteractionRecord to nanosec and find its max and min value within one cycle. Then duration = max - min.
2. convert InteractionRecord to nanosec and compute duration (as above) **for each processed timeframe (TF)**. Cycle duration = sum of durations of all TFs.
3. count TFs. Cycle duration = (#TF) * (#orbits per TF) * (orbit duration)

(#orbits per TF) = parameter (128 or 256).  
(orbit duration) = `o2::constants::lhc::LHCOrbitNS` = 88924.596 ns = 88 Âµs


First method fails if subsampling is used so methods 2. and 3. are prefered (cycle duration is similar as if no subsumpling is used but number of triggers is reduced).

In case of no subsampling there is still small difference between 1. and 2.: the reason is illustrated below: (duration total) is not exactly equal to (duration1+duration2+duration3) due to small spaces between first collision in TF *n+1* and last collision in TF *n*. The difference is small but visible in case of 1 kHz laser.

# Exemplary commands

### Simulation and digitization of data
1. Generate events and transport particles through detectors  
`o2-sim -g pythia6 -e TGeant3 -m FV0 FT0 FDD -j 2 -n 100`
2. Digitize hits only from selected detector (in my case it was FT0)  
`o2-sim-digitizer-workflow --onlyDet FT0 -b`  
Now file ft0digits.root should be generated in current workdir, one can use this file or follow next
steps to get more experiment like data
3. Convert MC digits to RAW data format as in experiment  
`o2-ft0-digi2raw`
4. Convert back RAW data format to digits  
`o2-raw-file-reader-workflow --input-conf FT0raw.cfg | o2-ft0-flp-dpl-workflow -b`

### Running QC

- on digits:  
`o2-fv0-digit-reader-workflow --fv0-digit-infile o2_fv0digits.root | o2-qc --config json:///qc_config.json -b`

- on digits in raw-TF files:  
`o2-raw-tf-reader-workflow --input-data run0504494/ | o2-fv0-digits-writer-workflow --disable-mc -b`

- on RAW in raw-TF files:  
`o2-raw-tf-reader-workflow --raw-only-det FV0 --input-data run0504494/ | o2-fv0-flp-dpl-workflow -b`

### Time Calibration workflow

-> Workflow to calibrate the measured time-distributions of partices by FT0/FV0 detectors. The measured time might be shifted with respect to the LHC clock. Calibration workflow produces these correction shifts (offsets) 
 for each detector channel and stores them as ROOT objects (vectors) into CCDB  (http://ccdb-test.cern.ch:8080/browse/FV0/Calibration/ChannelTimeOffset). Later on for calibrating data, these offsets 
 are applied to the incoming data. This procedure is checked by running the QC:

-> Running the workflows for FT0/FV0:
- `o2-ft0-digits-reader-workflow --ft0-digit-infile <path-to-digits-file> | o2-calibration-ft0-tf-processor | o2-calibration-ft0-channel-offset-calibration | o2-calibration-ccdb-populator-workflow`
- `o2-fv0-digit-reader-workflow --fv0-digit-infile <path-to-digits-file> | o2-calibration-fv0-tf-processor | o2-calibration-fv0-channel-offset-calibration | o2-calibration-ccdb-populator-workflow`

-> Running calibration QC for FT0/FV0:
- `o2-ft0-digits-reader-workflow --ft0-digit-infile <digit-root-file> | o2-qc --config json:///$HOME/alice/QualityControl/Modules/FV0/fv0-calibration-config.json -b --rate 1`
- `o2-fv0-digit-reader-workflow --fv0-digit-infile <digit-root-file> | o2-qc --config json:///$HOME/alice/QualityControl/Modules/FT0/ft0-calibration-config.json -b --rate 1`

Related classes are in O2: 
O2/Detectors/FIT/FV0/calibration/src/FV0ChannelTimeTimeSlotContainer.cxx (similar for FT0) 
    - To calculate the offset values (gaus-fit is implemented)
    - To find relavent classes for workflows: Check CMakeList.txt & search there for 'o2_add_executable'

for example :
`o2_add_executable(fv0-channel-offset-calibration
  COMPONENT_NAME calibration
  SOURCES workflow/FV0ChannelTimeCalibration-Workflow.cxx`

- Configuration options: While running the calibration workflow you can specify following options to have better calibration (add these options after o2-calibration-fv0-channel-offset-calibration ):
    -   --tf-per-slot=N : It will start the calibration after N timeframes are accumulated (N should be such number which can have sufficient data for calibration)
    -   --time-calib-fitting-nbins=M : This option for specifying histogram range for fitting gaussian .i.e M bins per side of the histogram maxima. (This will help to have robust fitting)
    -   --updateInterval : Options available but not used. Check the details here https://github.com/AliceO2Group/AliceO2/tree/dev/Detectors/Calibration#timeslotcalibrationinput-container
    -   --max-delay : 
                

# TODO List

* parameterize all paths -- it's important if we want to run not only on FLP but also on EPN (two tasks cannot have the same name, so one has to change them in the config for instance from "DigitQcTask" in FV0 and FT0 to "DigitQcTaskFV0" and "DigitQcTaskFT0"). It makes the hardcoded paths not valid.

* conversion of BcOrbitMaps to THnSparse or TH2I or even TH1  
  BcOrbitMaps are large: TH2F with 3564 x 256 bins. After taking first data one can think about changing them to THnSparse (but be careful about merging performance! maybe contact QC experts)  
  On the other hand, LHC filling scheme is basically 1D information, so one could consider dropping orbits completely and only use BC (to be consulted with detector experts).
